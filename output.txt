***my approach:
for these 2 majors, we can view them as a combination of core requirement, elective requirement, and department requirement.
And the correct logic is to check for unions in each 3 sections: the union of core requirements (the minimum courses that satisfy both core requirements) the union of elective requirements  (the minimum courses that satisfy both elective requirements)
and the department requirements (the mimimum courses that satisfies both department requirement)
***note that core requirements are not always named as core, and some majors may not have department requirements. 

1. for core requirements: 
For the first major cs+math:
the core requirements are:
SE 1301	Introduction to Computer Science	(3 credits)
CSE 2400	Logic and Discrete Mathematics **	(3 credits)
CSE 2407	Data Structures and Algorithms	(3 credits)
CSE 3407	Analysis of Algorithms	(3 credits)
MATH 1510	Calculus I **	(3 credits)
MATH 1520	Calculus II **	(3 credits)
MATH 2130	Calculus III **	(3 credits)
MATH 3010 Foundations for Higher Mathematics ** or MATH 3015 Foundations for Higher Mathematics With Writing **	(3 credits)
MATH 3300	Matrix Algebra **	(3 credits)
SDS 3020 Elementary to Intermediate Statistics and Data Analysis or SDS 3030 Statistics for Data Science I or ESE 3260 Probability and Statistics for Engineering	(3 credits)
Total Units	30

Second Major in Financial Engineering (ESE):

1. Background Coursework	15
CSE 1301	Introduction to Computer Science	3
ESE 3260	Probability and Statistics for Engineering	3
or SDS 3200
Elementary to Intermediate Statistics and Data Analysis
or DAT 1201
Managerial Statistics II
or ECON 3150
Introduction to Econometrics
or ECON 4150
Introduction to Econometrics With Writing
or SDS 4130
Linear Statistical Models
or SDS 4010
Probability
MATH 2500	Differential Equations	3
or ESE 2170
Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems Modeling in Engineering
or MATH 3520
Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems
MATH 2130	Calculus III	3
MATH 3300	Matrix Algebra	3
or ESE 2180
Linear Algebra and Component Analysis
or MATH 4301
Linear Algebra



for the core requirements of both majors, we can find that if we take:
SE 1301	Introduction to Computer Science	(3 credits)
CSE 2400	Logic and Discrete Mathematics **	(3 credits)
CSE 2407	Data Structures and Algorithms	(3 credits)
CSE 3407	Analysis of Algorithms	(3 credits)
MATH 1510	Calculus I **	(3 credits)
MATH 1520	Calculus II **	(3 credits)
MATH 2130	Calculus III **	(3 credits)
MATH 3010 Foundations for Higher Mathematics (3 credits)
MATH 3300	Matrix Algebra **	(3 credits)
SDS 3200 Elementary to Intermediate Statistics and Data Analysis (3 credits)

and

MATH 2500	Differential Equations	(3 credits)


we satisfy the core requirements for both majors.


*** apply this logic to the electives and department requirement, return the minimum electives and department requirement courses that satisfy both majors.
